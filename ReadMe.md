# Text2Speech

By using this Python code you can turn your text into speech 🤩

## Demo

And you can also see this project in demo and online in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iBJmwcK_XeHHPS4Tko2mxY5JyXob8I-D?usp=sharing) 🔗

To run this project as a demo, you need to run all the lines one by one to see the output 🙂🙃

## Files

In this repository you can see 3 types of files 🤔:
- Text2Speech.py:

  This file contains virtually all of the Python code used in Google Bolab (Mark Down's text and description inside Notebook have been commented on) 🙂🙃

- Text2Speech.ipynb:

  This file is actually the notebook file of this project (I myself recommend using this file in Colab or Jupyter) 🤩

- Text2Speech.pdf:

  This is a printout of the project's Colab page 😁
